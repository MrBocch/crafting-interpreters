## A Map of the Territory

I loved LOTR, where is this quote from?

> Much of this book is about a language's implementation,

what is this Plato stuff about?
im an uneducated swine

will he talk about Lox's language specification?

### The Parts of a Language

the way of building computer languages has not
changed much since they first built computers

the picture of the mountain

beggining mountain, we have the raw source code,
literally a string of characters

so at the peak of mountain, we see what
their code *means*

at the other side of mountain, how to make
the CPU actually execute

src code -> scanning -> tokens -> parsing -> syntax tree it splits of here

syntax tree -> transpiling -> high-level language

syntax tree -> analysis -> optimizing (INTERMEDIATE REPRESENTATION(S)) -> code generation

code generation -> transpiling -> high-level language

code generation -> bytecode -> virtual machine

code generation -> machine code

we will go from the very beggining

### Scanning
